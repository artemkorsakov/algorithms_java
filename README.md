# Algorithms
I use this project as a collection of algorithms. First of all, I need them to solve problems on <a href='https://projecteuler.net/about'>the Euler project</a>.
My results on the Euler project are <img src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/fonkost.png">. 
Here are only well-known algorithms - there are no solutions to problems from the Euler project. The reason is described <a href='https://projecteuler.net/about'>here</a> (paragraph "_I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?_").
